README for component-specific compliance
checking prototype
----------------------------------------

The NUOPCModel_ComplianceIC and NUOPCDriver_ComplianceIC modules 
in this prototype are based on the original compliance checker, 
but extends/alters it to add support for phase-specific compliance 
checks.

The original compliance checker attempted to define a general notion
of compliance that could be applied to all types of NUOPC components
at all phases of execution. This new approach recognizes that 
what constitutes a valid component state depends on the type of
component and its current phase in the overall execution flow. 

The code structure of this prototype is based off of v7-AtmOcnProto.

Currently, the new interface components are registered explicitly
in esm.F90 and esmApp.F90 and the ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK 
environment variable is IGNORED.


Dependencies:
  - ESMF v7.0.0 beta
  
Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.
  


Code structure:
  - NUOPCModel_ComplainceIC.F90 - Compliance checking component designed
    				              specifically for NUOPC Models
  - NUOPCDriver_ComplainceIC.F90 - Compliance checking component designed
    				              specifically for NUOPC Drivers
  - NUOPC_ComplianceMod.F90 - General compliance checks not that apply to
                              multiple NUOPC components

  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - ocn.F90     - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - esm.F90     - The Earth System Model (ESM) component, specializing generic
                  NUOPC_Driver.
  - esmApp.F90  - ESM driver application.
