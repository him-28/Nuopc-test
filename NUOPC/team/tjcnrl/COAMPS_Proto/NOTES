* I notice that "recursive subroutine" is used in NUOPC_Driver.  Is this
  required in components derived from NUOPC_Driver?

* Need to document for NUOPC_<blah> at which point in the initialization
  is the internal state available.

* ESMF_ConfigFindLabel automatically reports error to log when label is
  not found.  This means that ESMF_ConfigGetAttribute calls report error
  to the log even though a default value was provided.
