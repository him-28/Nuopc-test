* I notice that "recursive subroutine" is used in NUOPC_Driver.  Is this
  required in components derived from NUOPC_Driver?
  
  gjt: It is required if the derived driver component is going to drive driver
       components. Only those subroutines that potentially get into recursive
       calling stacks have the "recursive" attribute, and typically only very
       few of them would be specialized.

* Need to document for NUOPC_<blah> at which point in the initialization
  is the internal state available.
  
  gjt: Every NUOPC_xxx GenericComponent doc section now contains this
       information. Note that sometimes the allocation/deallocation of the
       internal state happens during Run().

* ESMF_ConfigFindLabel automatically reports error to log when label is
  not found.  This means that ESMF_ConfigGetAttribute calls report error
  to the log even though a default value was provided.

  gjt: Walter has this corrected on the TRUNK, and the next snapshot should
       have this fixed.

* Need to update documentation for NUOPC_RunSequence.  New API has j = 0
  indicating connector to driver.
  
  gjt: Done.
