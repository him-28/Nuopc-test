README for single Model NUOPC prototype
---------------------------------------

Dependencies:
  - ESMF v7.0.0 beta
  
Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - This application requires three input files stored in a 'data' directory.  The input files
    can be downloaded from ESMF's website.  Here are the commands to get the data
    and run the application:

	% mkdir -p data
        % cd data
        % wget -q -nd http://earthsystemmodeling.org/download/data/ipe3dgrid.nc
        % wget -q -nd http://earthsystemmodeling.org/download/data/wam3dgrid.nc
        % wget -q -nd http://earthsystemmodeling.org/download/data/sigf2009011512.nc
        % cd ..
        % .... get a partition to run the application .....
        % mpirun -np X ./mainApp (where X is the total number of PETs)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.
  


Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - IPE_Regrid.F90   - The IPE_Regrid Model component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - driver.F90  - Driver specializing NUOPC_Driver, driving the single MODEL.
  - mainApp.F90 - Main application cap.
