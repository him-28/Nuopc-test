README for Decomp Test NUOPC prototype
--------------------------------------

This prototype tests the efficiency of data distribution when domain 
decomposition is synchronized versus desynchronized. Domains are decomposed
over 256 PETs.

Dependencies:
  - ESMF v7.0.0 beta
  
Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - Enable/Disable domain decomposition synchronization in atm.F90 and ocn.F90
    DECOMPSYNC or DECOMPSYNC_disabled
  - Enable/Disable memory copy in con.F90. Memory copy will fail if DECOMPSYNC
    is diabled because the grid and grid distribution must match.
    MEMCOPY or MEMCOPY_disabled
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.
  


Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - ocn.F90     - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - con.F90     - The Connector component, specializing generic NUOPC_Connector.
  - esm.F90     - The Earth System Model (ESM) component, specializing generic
                  NUOPC_Driver.
  - esmApp.F90  - ESM driver application.
