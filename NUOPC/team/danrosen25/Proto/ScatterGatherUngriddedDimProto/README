README for Scatter Gather Ungridded Field NUOPC prototype
---------------------------------------------------------

A two model system with a Mediator. The first model has an ungridded dimension
that does not exist in the second model.

Description:

  A two-way coupled system with a single driver (ESM), two model components
  (ATM, OCN), and a mediator (MED).

  The ESM driver constructs a custom run sequence to implement coupling
  between ATM, OCN, and MED components. 
  
  The connector components are explicitly added by the driver.
  
  ATM uses a 3D field with 1 ungridded dimension.
  OCN uses a 2D field, all dimensions are gridded.
  Slices of the ungridded dimension are scattered and gathered in the mediator.

  If the mediator correctly scatters and gathers then all import field cells
  will contain 1s.


Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs, typically 4)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - settings.h  - Macro settings file
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - ocn.F90     - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - med.F90     - The Mediator component, specializing generic 
                  NUOPC_Mediator.
  - esm.F90     - The Earth System Model (ESM) component, specializing generic
                  NUOPC_Driver. Define partial petLists for ATM, OCN, and MED.
  - esmApp.F90  - ESM application.
