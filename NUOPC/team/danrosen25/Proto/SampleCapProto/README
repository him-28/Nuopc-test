README for Sample Driver + Sample Model Cap NUOPC prototype
-----------------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
  - ESMF v7.0.0
  
Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake          - Builds application with COMP1_MK=sample_cap.mk
  - gmake DEBUG=on - Builds application with COMP1_MK=sample_cap.mk and 
                     debugging information.
  
Runtime Configuration
  - Set runtime configuration in sample.rc
  - driver_name                  - Driver's name (default: DRIVER)
  - <DRIVER_NAME>_component_list - Driver's component list
  - <DRIVER_NAME>_attributes     - Driver's attributes
      verbosity                  - Driver's verbosity
      time_step_seconds          - Driver's time step
      step_count                 - Driver's step count
  - <COMPONENT>_mod              - Component's module name
  - <COMPONENT>_name             - Component's name
  - <COMPONENT>_attributes       - Component's attributes
      verbosity                  - Component's verbosity
      time_step_seconds          - Component's time step
      coupled_forcing            - Component's forcing mode
      realize_all_export         - Realize all export fields in component
      restart_seconds            - Components's restart file write interval

Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./sample_app.exe (where X is the total number of PETs)

Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs realized import and export state data at
    restart_seconds

Code structure:
  - makefile            - Makefile used to build or clean sample app and sample
                          model cap.
  - makefile.app        - Makefile used to build or clean sample app
  - makefile.sample_cap - Makefile used to build or clean sample cap
  - makefile.model      - Makefile used to build or clean sample model
  - sample_app.F90      - Main application
  - sample_driver.F90   - Driver specializing NUOPC_Driver, driving components 
                          listed in runtime configuration file.
  - sample_cap.F90      - Model specializing NUOPC_Model, wraps model domain, 
                          fields, initialization, run, and finalize with NUOPC
                          compliant entry points.
  - model_drv.F90       - The sample model
  - model_fld.F90       - The fields for the sample model
  - model_dom.F90       - The domain for the sample model
