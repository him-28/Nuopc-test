README for ATM-OCN NUOPC prototype
----------------------------------

Dependencies: 
  - ESMF_5_2_0r_beta_snapshot_05 or later. These snapshots contain the generic
    NUOPC code as ESMF addon.
  
Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.
  


Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_ModelExplicit.
  - ocn.F90     - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_ModelExplicit.
  - esm.F90     - The Earth System Model (ESM) component, specializing generic
                  NUOPC_DriverExplicitAtmOcn
  - esmApp.F90  - ESM driver application.
  
  
TODO:
  - Develop a standard way of documenting "Generic Components", that:
    1. shows how the generic Components relate to each other (hierarchy),
    2. shows how to specialize them, and
    3. shows the scenarious they are intented to be used in.
